Expansion board compatible with [Raspberry Pi 1 Modelo B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/model-b/)
 and [IGEP NEW YORK](https://isee.biz/products/igep-expansion-boards/igep-new-york) to control a RC CAR. Board Layout has been adapted to suite with [Nikko Mega Dominator](http://nikkoevolution.fr/voitures_et_pieces/568/Nikko-Mega-Dominator.html), but can be easily adaptable to another RC Car. Its features are:

* ATmega328 microcontroller: control all expansion board functionalities.
* Raspberry or IGEP boards (optional): control microcontroller through serial port.
* GPS expansion bus: [Adafruit Ultimate GPS Breakout](https://www.adafruit.com/product/746).
* Compass and accelerometer expansion bus: [Triple-axis Accelerometer+Magnetometer (Compass) Board - LSM303)](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1120).
* Gauge battery circuit.
* Servo and brushed motor drivers.
* Two independent power trees for electric motors and sensors&control.
* Atmega programer header.
* Hex segment display.
